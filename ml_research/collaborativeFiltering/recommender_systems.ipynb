    "- Popularity Recommender: Recommend popular songs regardless of user's preferences\n",

    "- Collaborative Recommender: Predict what songs a user might be interested in based on a collection of preference information from multiple users\n",
    "- Hybrid Recommender: A hybrid approach generally outperforms a single model and can be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start problem and the sparsity problem\n",
    "- HybridPopularity Recommender: An extension of the hybrid approach which applies weighting/mixes in songs based on popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this dataset we will focus on the playlist_tracks_df dataset and treat different playlists as different users. This is a strong approach for exploring recommendation techniques but leads to a problem the best way to recommend songs for our 'users' is based on genre (as my playlists tend to be genre-based)."

    "### Matrix Factorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent factor models compress a user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation in terms of latent factors. This has several advantages including fewer missing values, better scalability during similarity comparison, and that we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space. Note that model-based approaches handle the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory-based ones. An important number is the number of selected factors to factor the user-item matrix. The higher the number of factors, the more precise is the factorisation, and the more details of the original matrix which are memorized. Reducing the number of factors increases the model generalisation whilst too many factors can lead to overfitting (high variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we a use popular latent factor model named Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which is available in SciPy. Other choices might have been surprise, mrec, or python-recsys."
